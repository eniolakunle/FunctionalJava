# Exercise 4 â€»
___
Method references can make our code more readable. Write examples of using method references
in the context of your park: <br /> 
- Bound instance method: Use System.out::println to print dinosaur names.
- Unbound instance method: Use Dinosaur::getName (assume the Dinosaur class
has a getName() method) to get the name of each dinosaur.
- Static method: Use Collections::sort to sort a list of dinosaur names.
- Constructor reference: Use Dinosaur::new to create a new dinosaur (assume the
Dinosaur class has an appropriate constructor)
